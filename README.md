## Introduction
This project contains several digital circuit designs implemented in Logisim, a graphical tool for designing and simulating logic circuits. These circuits demonstrate fundamental concepts of digital logic, including basic gates, combinational logic, sequential logic, and more complex systems.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into multiple circuit files, each representing a different digital logic design:

- `HW2_1.circ`: Basic logic gates and their operations.
- `HW2_2.circ`: Combinational logic circuits.
- `HW2_3.circ`: Sequential logic circuits including flip-flops and registers.
- `HW2_4a.circ`: Part A of an advanced combinational logic design.
- `HW2_4b.circ`: Part B of an advanced combinational logic design.
- `HW2_5a.circ`: Part A of an advanced sequential logic design.
- `HW2_5b.circ`: Part B of an advanced sequential logic design.
- `HW2_6.circ`: A comprehensive project combining elements from previous designs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Logisim software, which can be downloaded from [Logisim's official website](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/).

### Installation
1. Download and install Logisim from the [official website](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/).
2. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digital-circuit-design.git
   cd digital-circuit-design
   ```

## Usage
1. Open Logisim.
2. Open any of the `.circ` files from the Logisim File menu or by double-clicking the file if Logisim is set as the default application for `.circ` files.
3. Simulate the circuit by interacting with the input switches and observing the output indicators.

## Circuit Descriptions

### HW2_1.circ
This file contains basic logic gates including AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR gates. It demonstrates their basic operations and truth tables.

### HW2_2.circ
Combinational logic circuits such as multiplexers, demultiplexers, encoders, decoders, and arithmetic circuits like adders and subtractors.

### HW2_3.circ
Sequential logic circuits, including various types of flip-flops (SR, D, JK, T) and simple register designs.

### HW2_4a.circ & HW2_4b.circ
Advanced combinational logic designs split into two parts. These circuits demonstrate complex combinational logic often used in larger digital systems.

### HW2_5a.circ & HW2_5b.circ
Advanced sequential logic designs split into two parts. These circuits demonstrate the use of sequential logic in more complex systems.

### HW2_6.circ
A comprehensive project that integrates concepts from previous circuits into a cohesive design, demonstrating a larger digital system with both combinational and sequential logic components.
